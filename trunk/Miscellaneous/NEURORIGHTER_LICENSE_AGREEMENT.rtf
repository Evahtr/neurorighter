\par   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
\par software and other kinds of works.
\par 
\par   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
\par to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
\par the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
\par share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
\par software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
\par GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
\par any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
\par your programs, too.
\par 
\par   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
\par price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
\par have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
\par them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
\par want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
\par free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
\par 
\par   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
\par these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
\par certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
\par you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
\par 
\par   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
\par gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
\par freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
\par or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
\par know their rights.
\par 
\par   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
\par (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
\par giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
\par 
\par   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
\par that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
\par authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
\par changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
\par authors of previous versions.
\par 
\par   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
\par modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
\par can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
\par protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
\par pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
\par use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
\par have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
\par products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
\par stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
\par of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
\par 
\par   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
\par States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
\par software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
\par avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
\par make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
\par patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
\par 
\par   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
\par modification follow.
\par 
\par                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par   0. Definitions.
\par 
\par   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
\par 
\par   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
\par works, such as semiconductor masks.
\par 
\par   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
\par License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
\par "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
\par 
\par   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
\par in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
\par exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
\par earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
\par 
\par   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
\par on the Program.
\par 
\par   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
\par permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
\par infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
\par computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
\par distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
\par public, and in some countries other activities as well.
\par 
\par   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
\par parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
\par a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
\par 
\par   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
\par to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
\par feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
\par tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
\par extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
\par work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
\par the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
\par menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
\par 
\par   1. Source Code.
\par 
\par   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
\par for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
\par form of a work.
\par 
\par   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
\par standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
\par interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
\par is widely used among developers working in that language.
\par 
\par   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
\par than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
\par packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
\par Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
\par Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
\par implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
\par "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
\par (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
\par (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
\par produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
\par 
\par   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
\par the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
\par work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
\par control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
\par System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
\par programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
\par which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
\par includes interface definition files associated with source files for
\par the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
\par linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
\par such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
\par subprograms and other parts of the work.
\par 
\par   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
\par can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
\par Source.
\par 
\par   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
\par same work.
\par 
\par   2. Basic Permissions.
\par 
\par   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
\par copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
\par conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
\par permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
\par covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
\par content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
\par rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
\par 
\par   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
\par convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
\par in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
\par of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
\par with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
\par the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
\par not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
\par for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
\par and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
\par your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
\par 
\par   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
\par the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
\par makes it unnecessary.
\par 
\par   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
\par 
\par   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
\par measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
\par 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
\par similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
\par measures.
\par 
\par   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
\par circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
\par is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
\par the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
\par modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
\par users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
\par technological measures.
\par 
\par   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
\par 
\par   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
\par receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
\par appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
\par keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
\par non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
\par keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
\par recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
\par 
\par   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
\par and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
\par 
\par   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
\par 
\par   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
\par produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
\par terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par 
\par     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
\par     it, and giving a relevant date.
\par 
\par     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
\par     released under this License and any conditions added under section
\par     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
\par     "keep intact all notices".
\par 
\par     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
\par     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
\par     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
\par     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
\par     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
\par     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
\par     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
\par 
\par     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
\par     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
\par     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
\par     work need not make them do so.
\par 
\par   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
\par works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
\par and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
\par in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
\par "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
\par used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
\par beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
\par in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
\par parts of the aggregate.
\par 
\par   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
\par 
\par   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
\par of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
\par machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
\par in one of these ways:
\par 
\par     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
\par     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
\par     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
\par     customarily used for software interchange.
\par 
\par     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
\par     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
\par     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
\par     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
\par     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
\par     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
\par     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
\par     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
\par     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
\par     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
\par     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
\par 
\par     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
\par     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
\par     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
\par     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
\par     with subsection 6b.
\par 
\par     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
\par     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
\par     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
\par     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
\par     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
\par     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
\par     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
\par     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
\par     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
\par     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
\par     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
\par     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
\par 
\par     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
\par     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
\par     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
\par     charge under subsection 6d.
\par 
\par   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
\par from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
\par included in conveying the object code work.
\par 
\par   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
\par tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
\par or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
\par into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
\par doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
\par product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
\par typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
\par of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
\par actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
\par is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
\par commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
\par the only significant mode of use of the product.
\par 
\par   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
\par procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
\par and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
\par a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
\par suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
\par code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
\par modification has been made.
\par 
\par   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
\par specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
\par part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
\par User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
\par fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
\par Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
\par by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
\par if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
\par modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
\par been installed in ROM).
\par 
\par   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
\par requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
\par for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
\par the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
\par network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
\par adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
\par protocols for communication across the network.
\par 
\par   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
\par in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
\par documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
\par source code form), and must require no special password or key for
\par unpacking, reading or copying.
\par 
\par   7. Additional Terms.
\par 
\par   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
\par License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
\par Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
\par be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
\par that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
\par apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
\par under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
\par this License without regard to the additional permissions.
\par 
\par   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
\par remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
\par it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
\par removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
\par additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
\par for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
\par 
\par   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
\par add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
\par that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
\par 
\par     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
\par     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
\par 
\par     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
\par     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
\par     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
\par 
\par     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
\par     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
\par     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
\par 
\par     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
\par     authors of the material; or
\par 
\par     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
\par     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
\par 
\par     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
\par     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
\par     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
\par     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
\par     those licensors and authors.
\par 
\par   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
\par restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
\par received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
\par governed by this License along with a term that is a further
\par restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
\par a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
\par License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
\par of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
\par not survive such relicensing or conveying.
\par 
\par   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
\par must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
\par additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
\par where to find the applicable terms.
\par 
\par   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
\par form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
\par the above requirements apply either way.
\par 
\par   8. Termination.
\par 
\par   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
\par provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
\par modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
\par this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
\par paragraph of section 11).
\par 
\par   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
\par license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
\par provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
\par finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
\par holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
\par prior to 60 days after the cessation.
\par 
\par   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
\par reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
\par violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
\par received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
\par copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
\par your receipt of the notice.
\par 
\par   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
\par licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
\par this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
\par reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
\par material under section 10.
\par 
\par   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
\par 
\par   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
\par run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
\par occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
\par to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
\par nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
\par modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
\par not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
\par covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
\par 
\par   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
\par 
\par   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
\par receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
\par propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
\par for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
\par 
\par   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
\par organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
\par organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
\par work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
\par transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
\par licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
\par give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
\par Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
\par the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
\par 
\par   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
\par rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
\par not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
\par rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
\par (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
\par any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
\par sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
\par 
\par   11. Patents.
\par 
\par   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
\par License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
\par work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
\par 
\par   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
\par owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
\par hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
\par by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
\par but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
\par consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
\par purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
\par patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
\par this License.
\par 
\par   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
\par patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
\par make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
\par propagate the contents of its contributor version.
\par 
\par   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
\par agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
\par (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
\par sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
\par party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
\par patent against the party.
\par 
\par   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
\par and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
\par to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
\par publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
\par then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
\par available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
\par patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
\par consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
\par license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
\par actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
\par covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
\par in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
\par country that you have reason to believe are valid.
\par 
\par   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
\par arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
\par covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
\par receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
\par or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
\par you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
\par work and works based on it.
\par 
\par   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
\par the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
\par conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
\par specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
\par work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
\par in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
\par to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
\par the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
\par parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
\par patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
\par conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
\par for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
\par contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
\par or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
\par 
\par   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
\par any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
\par otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
\par 
\par   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
\par 
\par   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
\par otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
\par excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
\par covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
\par License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
\par not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
\par to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
\par the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
\par License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
\par 
\par   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
\par 
\par   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
\par permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
\par under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
\par combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
\par License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
\par but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
\par section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
\par combination as such.
\par 
\par   14. Revised Versions of this License.
\par 
\par   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
\par the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
\par be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
\par address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
\par Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
\par Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
\par option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
\par version or of any later version published by the Free Software
\par Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
\par GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
\par by the Free Software Foundation.
\par 
\par   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
\par versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
\par public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
\par to choose that version for the Program.
\par 
\par   Later license versions may give you additional or different
\par permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
\par author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
\par later version.
\par 
\par   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
\par 
\par   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
\par APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
\par HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
\par OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
\par THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
\par PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
\par IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
\par ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\par 
\par   16. Limitation of Liability.
\par 
\par   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
\par WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
\par THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
\par GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
\par USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
\par DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
\par PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
\par EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
\par SUCH DAMAGES.
\par 
\par   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
\par 
\par   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
\par above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
\par reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
\par an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
\par Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
\par copy of the Program in return for a fee.
\par 
\par                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par 
\par             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
\par 
\par   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
\par possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
\par free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
\par 
\par   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
\par to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
\par state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
\par the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par 
\par     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
\par     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
\par 
\par     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
\par     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
\par     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
\par     (at your option) any later version.
\par 
\par     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
\par     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
\par     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
\par     GNU General Public License for more details.
\par 
\par     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
\par     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
\par 
\par Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
\par 
\par   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
\par notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
\par 
\par     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
\par     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
\par     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
\par     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
\par 
\par The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
\par parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
\par might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
\par 
\par   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
\par if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
\par For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
\par <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
\par 
\par   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
\par into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
\par may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
\par the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
\par Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

2. Grant of License. In consideration of payment of the applicable fees to NI, NI is willing to provide you with a limited, non-excl
usive right to use the SOFTWARE, but only pursuant and subject at all times to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The SOFTWARE is in "use" when loaded into temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, 
D
VD-ROM, network storage device, or other storage device). Except as expressly authorized under this Section 2, floating, concurrent, or shared use is not permitted under this Agreement. The specific use rights granted to you are as follows and depend upon
 the type of license you have acquired: 
\par A. Named User License. If you have acquired a named user license, you must designate in writing (through the NI registration process) one (1) named user for the license (the "Named User"). The SOFTWARE may be install
ed on up to three computers in a single workplace of the designated Named User. Only the designated Named User, however, may use or otherwise run the SOFTWARE and the SOFTWARE may not be run concurrently (i.e., it may only be launched on one computer at a
 
time). At your discretion, you may convert a named user license to a single seat license whereupon the SOFTWARE may only be installed and used on one (1) computer in your workplace. While all of the SOFTWARE must be installed and used on the same computer
 
under a single seat license, there is no limitation on the number of your personnel that may access and use the SOFTWARE on such computer; provided, however, that the SOFTWARE may not be run concurrently (i.e., only one instance of the SOFTWARE can be lau
n
ched on one computer at a time). Regardless of whether the SOFTWARE is used under a named user license or a single seat license, in no event may any of the SOFTWARE be installed or used on a network storage device. If you have a VLP License or Surviving V
L
P License and you want to convert named user licenses to single seat licenses, you must give written notice to NI so that NI can send you a new license file reflecting the revised number of named user licenses. You may transfer a named user license to ano
ther designated user provided that no more than four (4) such transfers may occur per year. Once a designated Named User has transferred their license to a new user, such new user must reregister with NI the named user license in their own name. 
\par B. Volume/
VLP License. If you have acquired the right to use the SOFTWARE for multiple users under the Volume License Program ("VLP"), you shall install and use an Approved Volume License Manager with the most current license file provided to you by NI that control
s
 end-user access to the SOFTWARE licensed under the VLP. During the VLP Term, you may distribute the master installation disk(s) containing the SOFTWARE for internal installation and use only on those computers located at the Site(s). In addition to being
 
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the "Notes" sub-section below, your use of the SOFTWARE under the VLP shall at all times (during the VLP Term and thereafter) also be subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement regardin
g
 the specific type of VLP License you have acquired under the VLP. As part of the VLP, you must, for each individual VLP License, acquire and maintain during the term of the VLP the Software Services for the SOFTWARE identified in the applicable VLP Docum
entation and for which NI makes such Software Services available. 
\par C. Concurrent Use License. If you have acquired a concurrent use license, you may install the SOFTWARE for use by Authorized Users at the Sites; provided, however, in no event may the number
 of Authorized Users who are accessing and/or using any of the SOFTWARE at the same time (i.e., concurrent users) exceed the Maximum Number of Seats which you have purchased. You agree that you will also use an Approved Volume License Manager and the lice
n
se file provided by NI that controls end-user access to the SOFTWARE to ensure compliance with the foregoing. Your concurrent use license will automatically terminate if the number of concurrent users of the SOFTWARE at any time exceeds the Maximum Number
 
of Seats which you have purchased. If you do not timely renew your Software Service, should you later desire to obtain Upgrades for the software, you may be required to pay NI an applicable Upgrade fee for each such seat. As used herein, the term "Authori
z
ed Users" means end-users at the Sites who use the SOFTWARE; the term "Sites" means your facility to which NI initially delivered the SOFTWARE and all of your facilities within the same country; and the term "Maximum Number of Seats" means the number of s
e
ats you have acquired as designated in the applicable quote or other documents provided to you by NI. For purposes of the concurrent use license, all facilities located in a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement or South America shall be consi
d

\par (1.) Program Requirements. You shal
l designate a separate Software Administrator for each Site and shall promptly notify NI in writing of any changes to the Software Administrator(s). In order to participate in the VLP, the VLP Licenses that you maintain during the VLP Term must at all tim
e
s include a minimum of five (5) copies (in the aggregate) of versions of the SOFTWARE, which are considered by NI to be development versions of the SOFTWARE. NI will deliver the master installation disks for the SOFTWARE and, if provided for in the applic
a
ble written quotation from NI, make available the NI VLM to the Software Administrator(s). You are responsible for ensuring that an Approved Volume License Manager, together with the most current license file provided by NI that controls end-user access t
o
 the SOFTWARE, is in use at all times with the SOFTWARE licensed under the VLP (during the term of the VLP and thereafter). If the Approved Volume License Manager is the NI VLM or if NI makes documentation available for the applicable Approved Volume Lice
n
se Manager, such Approved Volume License Manager shall be installed and used in accordance with the documentation provided by NI. If you have existing individual, single seat or named user licenses for the SOFTWARE that are to be covered by the VLP, (i) y
o
u shall notify NI in writing of the product, platform, and serial number information for each such license; (ii) each such license shall (as of the VLP Effective Date) no longer be in effect and shall be superseded by the VLP; (iii) all individual serial 
n
umbers for each such license shall be cancelled and replaced by a single, common serial number assigned to the VLP and the corresponding VLP Licenses; and (iv) should you later desire to obtain individual serial numbers for any of the VLP Licenses, you wi
l
l be required to pay NI its then current fee for a conversion from a VLP License to an individual named user license, single seat license, or debug license having an individual serial number. Regarding Software Service, NI reserves the right to restrict S
oftware Service to the then most current version of the SOFTWARE that is commercially available. You understand that NI may not make available Software Service for all SOFTWARE available under the VLP. 
\par (2.) Activity Compliance Logs. In addition to the subm
ission requirement in sub-section (4.) below, you are required to provide an Activity Compliance Log for each Site to NI promptly (but in no event later than fifteen (15) days) following (i) the annual anniversary of the VLP Effective Date during the VLP 
Term and (ii) the VLP Termination Date. NI may, upon notice to you, inspect the Site(s) and

\par c. in the amount of the VLP Renewal Fees prior to the end of the then current VLP Term as set forth below if you desire to renew the VLP. 
\par You are required to obtain and maintain Software Services for each VLP License for which Software Services are m
ade available by NI. The Software Services are charged on an annual basis and, for VLP Licenses added during the VLP Term, will only be pro-rated on a quarterly basis (based on the quarter of the VLP Term in which the SOFTWARE under such VLP License was f
irst used) if a purchase order is submitted to NI prior to the date the SOFTWARE for the Additional VLP License is installed or otherwise used. All invoices shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the date you receive them. 
\par (4.) VLP Term. The initial Term
 of the VLP will start on the VLP Effective Date and continue for a period of one (1) year (the "Initial VLP Term"). You may renew the VLP for additional one (1) year periods (the Initial VLP Term and each such renewal term, each herein referred to herein
 
as a "VLP Term"). Should you desire to renew the VLP for an additional one (1) year period, you must provide a current Activity Compliance Log to NI at least sixty (60) days before the end of the then current VLP Term so that the number of VLP Licenses fo
r
 the SOFTWARE may be determined. NI will then provide you with a quote for Software Services, any Additional VLP Fees that are applicable, and any new VLP Licenses that you request for the renewal VLP Term (the "VLP Renewal Fee"). The VLP will be renewed 
f
or an additional one (1) year period each time you issue to NI a purchase order for the VLP Renewal Fees prior to the end of the then current VLP Term. You shall promptly notify NI if the information in the Activity Compliance Log regarding the number of 
V
LP Licenses changes following your submission, and NI reserves the right to revise the VLP Renewal Fee (as applicable) to reflect Additional VLP Licenses used and not reflected in the applicable Activity Compliance Log that you provided to NI at the time 
you desired to renew. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af1\afs18 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\fs18\insrsid12662954

r
anty"). Any replacement SOFTWARE will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an express or implied warranty, so the above o
r
 any other limitation provided herein may not apply to you. In such event, such warranties are limited to the minimum warranty period allowed by applicable law. You must obtain a Return Material Authorization number from NI before returning the SOFTWARE u
n
der warranty to NI and you agree to pay expenses for shipment to and from NI. The Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, improper calibration by you, third party products (i.e., hardware or s

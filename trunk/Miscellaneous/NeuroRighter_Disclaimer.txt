NeuroRighter Disclaimer

The NeuroRighter software is open-source, free software, released under the GNU Public License 
(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt), a copy of which is included in the source code and in the 
application directory, where the program is installed.

NeuroRighter was written by John Rolston (rolston2@gmail.com) in the course of his PhD thesis at 
Emory University and Georgia Tech.  It was written for a particular class of experiments (closed loop 
stimulation of epileptic animals), and therefore has a limited feature set.  It has only been tested on a 
limited number of computers, and under a limited range of conditions.  Therefore, it is possible that 
the software will be unstable when run in different settings.  We therefore take no responsibility for 
any problems caused by installing or using this software.  However, we eagerly solicit feedback and 
bug reports.  

Please help us make this software better by documenting any errors encountered, or features that 
you would like to see.  Also, feel free to contribute to the NeuroRighter project by modifying the 
source code directly.  You can add features, improve application performance, or branch the software 
into a completely different project.  Keep us posted: we’d love to hear about your work.

Sincerely,
John Rolston
on behalf of the NeuroRighter Development Team
